## Effective Java [Notes]

- Fundamental Libraries - java.util, java.lang, java.io, java.util.concurrent
- Four types:
    - interfaces (including annotations) [Reference type]
    - classes (including enums) [Reference type]
    - arrays [Reference type]
    - primitives
- Class instances and arrays are objects
- A Class's members are:
    - fields
    - methods
    - member classes
    - member interfaces
- Method's signature = method name + types of formal parameters [Does not include method's return type]
- Access level when none is specified - defautl access [means package private]
